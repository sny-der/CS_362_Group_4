# Weekly Status Report
## Team Report
### Goals from a week ago
- Get Basic GUI running
- Create classes and skeleton code for each comppoment of our program by 2/18/2026, see team resources for program components
- Complete use-case 3 in team resources document
##### For Basic beta version of program: 
- Write code for finding users, test code with testing criteria, review code with any notes on the commit / pull messages
- Write code for connecting users, test code with testing criteria, review code with any notes on the commit / pull messages
- Write code for splitting and commbining files, and packaging them up to be sent / received, test code with testing criteria, review code with any notes on the commit / pull messages
- Test sending data of connection, use testing criteria, review code with any notes on the commit / pull messages
### Progress and Issues
- Implemented splitter/reassembler component, which also handles the file manager interface.
- Added CI workflow to repository, to ensure added code is valid
- Added encryption engine but need connection manager to be working in order to test the Diffie-Hellman handshake.
- Basic UI has been implemented but still needs functionality; buttons don't work yet.  

### Plan and goals for the following week
- Create all components for the program to ensure integration can start on time
- Begin testing and integration of all components to ensure program will perform when it is due to be delivered

### Abram
#### Goals from a week ago
- add code and implement the encryption engine by 2/26/2026
- add code and implement the Diffie-Hellman handshake by 2/26/2026
- Create tests and/or test suite for the ecnryption engine and handshake protocol by 2/28/2026
#### Progress and Issue
- Added handshake manager class and encrytpion engine class. Further configuring is needed once connections manager has been impemented.
- Still working on unit, validation, integration, and system tests for the handshake manager and encryption engine; I'm just unfamiliar with CI and figuring out how it works with our specific project. 
#### Plan and goals for the following week
- Add/edit code for encrytion engine to better work with the file splitter and connection manager, due as soon as connection manager is working. 
- Add unit, validation, integration, and system tests to CI, get done by 2/28/2026.
- Contribute to documentation for the develper manual about encryption and handshake protocol. 

### Charles
#### Goals from a week ago
- Work on the networking system and integrate the file transfer.
#### Progress and Issues
- Created basic sender/receiver to allow for sending and receiving functionality
#### Plan and goals for the following week
- Rewrite the python script and c code to allow other python scripts to use the packet scripts via calling python functions. (might have to modify filesplitter and diffe hellman)
- Add the rest of the features. Prioritise packet queue and re-requesting.
- Integrate Diffe Hellman.

### Jonathan
#### Goals from a week ago
- Write splitter/reassembler component and test to verify it works correctly
- Identify CI workflow for repository
#### Progress and Issues
- Added splitter/reassembler component
- Performed proof-of-concept testing for splitter/reassembler
- Added CI workflow to repository
#### Plan and goals for the following week
- Integrate splitter/reassembler
- Test splitter/reassembler to ensure it performs correctly with other components

### Arjun
